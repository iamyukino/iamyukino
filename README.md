### Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Yukino Amamiya, a student who loves C++ & Typescript.  
Iâ€™m keen on studying features of the c++ standard and have written dozens of articles.  
Welcome to following me.  

I'm currently imitating pygame to implement a graphics library called mclib in C++.  
[This is a link](https://iamyukino.github.io/) to my website where I record my studies and articles.
