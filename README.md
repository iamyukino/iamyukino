### Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Yukino Amamiya, a student who loves C++ & Typescript.  
Iâ€™m keen on studying features of c++ standard and have written dozens of articles.  
Welcome to following me.

I'm currently imitating pygame to implement a graphics library called mclib in C++.  
The above image is a link to my website where I record my studies and articles.
